# [HEALTH FILES]

</div>

## Introduction

The [default repository](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) to store default health files for my default projects.

These files will be used as defaults for my small projects, but complex implementations will have customized ones.

Having defaults never hurts... :nail_care:
