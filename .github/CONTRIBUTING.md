## Introduction

:tada: _First of all, thank you for considering contributing to the project!_ :tada:

There are two common ways to contribute and improve the project:

- **Report a bug/issue** related to the project behavior, features or documentation 
- **Solve a bug/issue** related to the project behavior, features or documentation

Both of them are equally appreciated, so once again, thank you very much for your time and dedication to make this project even better!

## How to report a bug/issue

[Reporting a bug or creating an issue is very straightforward](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue):

1. Go to the main page of the repository
2. Click **Issues**
3. Click **New issue**
4. Select one of the templates that we have here for you to facilitate finish the process
5. Thank you very much! Now the project improves thanks to you, and you are my new coder best friend, yeah :beers:

## How to solve a bug/issue

These types of contributions are done using the [fork & pull model](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#fork-and-pull-model):

1. Fork and clone the repository locally
2. Create a new branch from the default branch and give it a descriptive name (e.g. `add-chat` or `fix-chat`)
3. As a general practice, to commit your changes, use commit messages that follows the [Conventional Commit specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and include a reference to the issue number in the format: `<type>(<scope>): <description> [#<issue-number>]`
4. When you're finished with the changes, [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
5. Thank you very much! Oh! You are the best coder friends, so I will give you the best gift: A pic of [Messi smiling](./CONTRIBUTING/messi-smiling.jpg)
